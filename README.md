# Sales-Prediction
Historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions are available in the dataset used here. Each day, specific occasions and holidays have an impact on sales. Unforeseen demand is a hurdle for the company, and occasionally stock runs out because of a bad machine learning system. The Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas are the four biggest holidays that are taken into account in this case study. A perfect machine learning algorithm will precisely estimate demand and take into account variables like the CPI, unemployment rate, and other economic indicators. An exploratory data analysis is performed on the data to extract useful insights about the patterns in sales. Further a times series modelling is built to forecast the upcoming sales.
